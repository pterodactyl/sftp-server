# Pterodactyl SFTP Server
This package serves as a SFTP server to run alongside the [Pterodactyl Daemon](https://github.com/pterodactyl/daemon).
It is not designed to run stand-alone on your system.

## Why?
Previously we made use of Node.js to handle running our SFTP server for the Daemon. While this worked, and has allowed us
to provide more advanced permissions and keep things off the host OS, it has also lead to many issues. Most notably has
been extremely poor performance when trying to work with directories containing hundreds or thousands of files. In addition,
this poor performance has also caused bottlenecking in the application when it comes to managing servers.

Our goal with the introduction of this standalone server is to provide a lean, performant, fully-featured SFTP server
that will hold up the the demands placed upon it.

## Running
To run this program in a standalone mode (rather than booted by the Daemon), use the arguments below.

```
./sftp-server [--config-path] [--port] [--bind-addr] [--readonly] [--disable-disk-check] [--debug]
```

### Flags
```
flag          default            help
--config-path       ./config/core.json This flag defines the location of the Daemon configuration file which
                                       is read to help determine some internal settings.

--port               2022              The port for the SFTP server.

--bind-addr          0.0.0.0           The bind address for the SFTP server.

--readonly           false             If provided, the server will run in a read-only state that denies anyone,
                                       regardless of permission, from writing or modifying files.

--disable-disk-check false             If passed, disk space usage will be disabled.

--debug              false             If passed, the server will run in debug mode which can be useful for printing
                                       stacktraces and additional connection and error information.
